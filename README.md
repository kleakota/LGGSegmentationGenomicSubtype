# LGGSegmentationGenomicSubtype
This is a Deep Learning project which aims to segment and extract radiomic features from LGGs and find significant associations between the tumor features and genomic subtypes. The project compares between two segmentation techniques of UNET with FPN backbone and UNET with ResNeXt50 backbone to find the best performing model.
